# About speech-recognization-system
This is my implementation of course project about building a speech recognization sytem. Thanks Ming Li (Professor at SYSU-CMU Joint Institute of Engineering) very much for his excellent teaching. Also, I wanna express my deep gratitude to my family, my mum, my dad, who have always cared about me, supported and helped me.

I love artificial intelligence and machine learning, and this could be my first big project in the field of natural language processing. I will try my best to finish it in the next few months.

# Progress report of the project
1. endpointing and feature computation, finished at 2015/3/19.
2. dynamic time warping, todo

I have stopped updating the programs. There has been so many friendly open apis of speech-recognization. If you want to know more basic ideas about this area, you can still find some articles at my blog http://www.ramlinbird.com/tag/design_and_implementation_of_sr/. Thanks a lot for your concern.
